# calibration-equivalence-using-sphere
The simlulation [code](https://github.com/Eric-Zhuo/calibration-equivalence-using-sphere) for the paper "Geometric Calibration Equivalence: Unifying Double Contact Theorem and Common Self-polar Triangle Using Separate Sphere Images".

### Requirements 

* MATLAB



### Requirements

If you wan to test the calibration algorithm based on double contact theorem, just run DC.m;
If you wan to test the calibration algorithm based on common self-polar triangle, just run T.m. 

Please cite our paper, if the code is used for publishing research.
