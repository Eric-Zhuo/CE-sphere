# calibration-equivalence-using-sphere
The simlulation code for the paper "Calibration Equivalence Between Double Contact Theorem and Common Self-polar Triangle Using Separate Sphere Images".

Please cite our paper, if the code is used for publishing research.

If you wan to test the calibration algorithm based on double contact theorem, just run DC.m;
If you wan to test the calibration algorithm based on common self-polar triangle, just run T.m.
